# Quantum-State-Preparation

Quantum state preparation (QSP) is first and crucial step for finding quantum algorithms. QSP uses $\mathcal{l}$ number of 

quantum gates in a quantum circuit ($U$) to bring the ground state $\ket{0}$ to the desired (or target) state $\ket{\psi}$, such

that $\ket{\psi}$ = $U_l\ket{0})$. $U$ must imput each unique amplitude $c_x$ via a rotation.
